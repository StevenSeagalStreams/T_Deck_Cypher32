# Cypher32

You are a ghost in the machine.

Cypher32 is a **physical hacking game** played on hardware you carry. Each device is a node — a silent transmitter hunting for others across the electromagnetic spectrum. When two players come within range their devices find each other automatically over LoRa radio, no internet, no infrastructure, no trail. From there you run recon, probe defenses, and strike. Win enough fights and you level up. Lose and you bleed XP.

No apps. No accounts. No names transmitted. Just chip IDs, stats, and outcomes.

The game runs on a **Heltec Wireless Paper V1.2** — an ESP32-S3 with a 250×122 e-ink display and a long-range SX1262 radio crammed onto a board the size of a credit card. Everything is controlled through a minimal web portal your device serves over its own Wi-Fi signal.

Your character is always watching you from the display. Its mood changes with your performance.

## First-time setup

Flash it. Power it. Pick a side. That's all it takes to enter the network.

### Step 1 — Flash the firmware

**From your browser — no toolchain.** Open
**[the installer page](https://stevenseagalstreams.github.io/Cypher32/)**, plug
the board in over USB, pick a range profile and press one button.

That needs the Web Serial API, which today means **Chrome, Edge or Opera on a
desktop computer**. Firefox and Safari do not implement it, and neither does
any phone or tablet browser — including Chrome on Android. The page says so
before you get as far as the button.

**It checks the board before it writes anything.** Press *Check this board* and
the page asks the chip what it is over the serial bootloader — nothing is
flashed by that step. It confirms the chip family and the flash size, and the
install button stays locked until it passes.

Both of those matter. The family is what makes the image runnable at all; the
flash size is what makes it fit, because Cypher32 is built against an 8 MB
partition table and a 4 MB ESP32-S3 would accept the image and then misbehave.
The installer itself only checks the family, so the size check is the one that
catches that mistake.

What it *cannot* do is prove the board is specifically a Wireless Paper — a
Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 is also an ESP32-S3 with 8 MB and looks identical over
the bootloader. The page says "consistent with" rather than "confirmed", and
reports the USB bridge as corroboration rather than proof. If the check cannot
run at all — an unreachable library, a port held by a serial monitor — it says
so and lets you install anyway, because a check that fails is not evidence
about your board.

Every image there is built by GitHub Actions from the commit it names, and
carries the **public default `LORA_KEY`** — so anyone who flashes from that
page can hear anyone else who did. That is the point for a public game; for a
private one, change the key and build it yourself.

<details>
<summary><b>Or build it yourself</b></summary>

**Arduino IDE:**
1. Install the **Heltec ESP32** board package via Boards Manager.
2. Install these libraries via Library Manager:
   - **RadioLib** (version 7.1 or later)
   - **heltec-eink-modules**
3. Open `cypher32.ino`. All headers must be in the same folder.
4. Select board: **Heltec Wireless Paper**.
5. Click **Upload**.

**PlatformIO:**
```
pio run -e long -t upload      # or -e fast / -e epic
```
Dependencies are declared in `platformio.ini` and pulled automatically. There
is one environment per range profile; `long` is the default.

</details>

---

### Step 2 — Power on

Connect a LiPo battery or plug in USB. The e-ink display boots, then holds on the **setup screen** — waiting for you to identify yourself.

The device is already broadcasting. An open Wi-Fi network named **`Cypher32`** appears. No password. No ceremony.

---

### Step 3 — Connect

<img src="docs/img/eink-setup-qr.png" width="440" alt="The join screen: a QR code beside SCAN TO JOIN, the SSID, and 'No password. Then 192.168.4.1'">

The device shows a **Wi-Fi QR code** on its screen. Point your camera at it and
your phone offers to join — no typing an SSID. (Any time later, HUD → SHOW JOIN
QR ON DEVICE puts it back up for a minute so someone else can scan it.)

Or join **`Cypher32`** manually. The portal should open by itself —
the device runs a captive portal, so your phone's "sign in to network" prompt
lands you straight on it.

If it doesn't, open a browser and go to:

```
192.168.4.1
```
or `cypher32.local`

A three-step setup walks you through what the game is, what each faction does,
and setting a password.

---

### Step 4 — Choose your faction and set a password

<img src="docs/img/portal-setup.png" width="280" align="right" alt="The first-run wizard: four faction cards to choose from">

The setup screen asks two things:

1. **Faction** — your allegiance, your combat style, your starting advantage. Not reversible without a full wipe. Choose what fits how you fight (see [Factions](#factions)).
2. **Password** — the device's Wi-Fi is open by design, so anyone nearby can
   reach this page. The password is what stops them spending your skill points
   or wiping your character. Minimum six characters.

Hit **ESTABLISH UPLINK**. The device goes dark for a moment.

---

### Step 5 — You're in

The firmware derives your **hacker name** from your chip ID — deterministic and
permanent, the same name every time this device boots. Crucially it is the
*same* derivation every other device uses, so the name on your screen is the
name your messages arrive under. Nothing about the name is ever transmitted.

There are 576 possible names, so a collision between two devices is unlikely
but not impossible once you have a few dozen in play.

<br clear="all">

The display comes alive:

<img src="docs/img/eink-idle.png" width="440" alt="The idle screen">

- Name, faction, and level in the header
- Your character — idle for now, watching
- A speech bubble with something to say
- XP bar and skill indicators along the bottom

Your Wi-Fi SSID has changed to `C32_<Faction>_<Name>`. The portal is readable by
anyone, but every action now needs your password. Your device beacons every
12–18 seconds at first so nearby players find you quickly, settling to 25–35
seconds once you've been discovered.

> **Factory reset:** tap **RST** twice quickly, then hold **PRG** for 5 seconds.
> The screen confirms before it wipes. This needs no password — holding the
> button on the device is the proof you own it, so it is also the way back in
> if you forget one.
>
> Both buttons are involved because RST is wired to the ESP32's reset pin
> rather than a GPIO: software cannot read it, so the double tap is inferred
> from two boots cut short in a row, and PRG confirms.

---

## Web portal

Your command interface. Connect to the device's Wi-Fi and open **192.168.4.1**.

</table>

| Tab | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **HUD** | Level, XP, skills, battery, radio status, manual beacon |
| **Radar** | Everyone in range, sorted by signal — recon and hack from here |
| **Skills** | Spend skill points from level-ups |
| **Msgs** | Send and receive LoRa text — 32 chars max |
| **Log** | The last 20 things that happened, newest first |
| **Config** | Contact alert, password, identity, node list, factory reset, diagnostics |

The page never reloads. It polls the device twice a second, so signal strength,
cooldown countdowns and action status update live.

**Contact alert.** When a node you have never seen before comes into range, the
phone plays three notes — A, C, G, two detuned squares each, through a
resonant filter and a short feedback delay. Synthesised on the page, so there
is no audio file anywhere. The device shows a discovery on its screen for a few
seconds and then goes back to idle, which is no use with the device in a bag;
this is. It needs the page open and the phone awake, and some captive-portal
mini-browsers refuse to play audio at all — open `192.168.4.1` in Chrome or
Safari if you hear nothing. Off switch and a test button are in **Config**.

**Every action tells you what happened.** Press HACK and you get
`SENDING… → WAITING FOR REPLY (2/4) → SUCCESS`, or `NO RESPONSE — out of range?`
if the target never answered. Nothing fails silently.

---

## Factions

Four factions. Each one plays differently. Pick the one that matches your instinct — you can't change it without losing everything.

| Faction | Bonus | Perk | Risk |
|---------|-------|------|------|
| **BLACK** | +3 Brute Force | +20% XP on every successful hack | Full 15 XP loss on fail — no mitigation |
| **WHITE** | +3 Firewall | Fail penalty halved; attacks restricted to BLACK and RED | Limited target pool |
| **RED** | +3 Stealth | +25% XP against GREEN targets | 15% chance of XP loss even on a win |
| **GREEN** | +1 all skills | +10% XP against BLACK targets | 25% XP-loss risk when attacking WHITE |

**BLACK** hits hard and pays for every failure in full.  
**WHITE** plays a defensive game and picks its fights carefully.  
**RED** is a gambler — even victories carry risk.  
**GREEN** starts balanced but earns less unless it exploits its matchups.

---

## Skills

One **Skill Point** per level-up. Spend it in the **Skills** tab. At high levels every point shifts the math.

| Skill | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Brute Force** | +2% hit chance per point over the target's Firewall |
| **Stealth** | +1% hit chance per point — and Firewall can't cancel it |
| **Firewall** | Cuts XP lost when your hack fails (floor 5), and blunts Brute Force aimed at you |

Cap: **35** per skill (3 from faction + 32 earned through levels).

---

## Levelling

Every successful hack earns XP. Enough and you level up. The climb gets steeper the higher you go.

- **Max level:** 32
- **XP to clear a level:** `currentLevel × 10` — 10 at LVL 1, 100 at LVL 10,
  310 at LVL 31. Each level costs more than the last.
- **XP per hack:** `15 + target's Firewall × 5` — tougher targets pay more
- XP floor is 0. At LVL 32, surplus XP is discarded.

Reaching LVL 32 takes 4,960 XP, roughly 165 winning hacks. Early levels go
quickly — one good hack can carry you through two or three at the start — and
the climb lengthens steadily from there.

---

## How hacking works

This is what it's all for.

**1. Find a target.**  
Contacts appear in the **Radar** tab when their beacon reaches you, sorted by
signal strength with a plain-language range — VERY CLOSE, CLOSE, DISTANT,
FADING. That is *all* you get. No name, no faction, no level. An unscouted
contact is a signal, not a person.

**2. Run recon.**  

<img src="docs/img/portal-recon.png" width="300" align="right" alt="The recon mini-game: a 3x3 grid with one tile lit, and beneath it the intel panel with codename, faction, level and brute filled in while stealth, firewall and backdoor are still locked">

Recon is a **sequence-memory game**, and it is how anybody becomes somebody. A
grid of tiles flashes a pattern; repeat it. Each round adds one step. Every
round you clear strips another layer off the target — and the layer lands the
moment the round does, while you are still playing:

| Round | What comes back |
|-------|-----------------|
| 2 | their **codename** |
| 4 | their **faction** |
| 6 | their **level** |
| 7 | their **Brute Force** |
| 8 | their **Stealth** |
| 9 | their **Firewall** — the Radar stops saying "odds unknown" |
| 10 | a **backdoor** |

<br clear="all">

The furthest round you complete is also your recon score, worth `score × 1.5%`
on your hack odds — a perfect run gives the full **+15%**, putting a level
starting hack at **75%**.

One wrong tile ends the run. Everything you already pulled is yours to keep;
the rest stays dark.

**A perfect 10 leaves a backdoor open.** Their file stops expiring when the
cooldown does, their level and faction keep updating off their beacons on their
own, and walking back in costs you neither an attempt nor another game — one
tap re-pulls the whole dossier. It survives a reboot. It is the only thing in
the game that does.

You get **three attempts per node**, and an attempt is only spent once you
actually pull something: a target that never answers, or a run that dies in the
first round, costs nothing. Spend all three and recon is closed until that
node's cooldown ends — then it resets, three fresh attempts, and the file goes
back to a signal with no name on it. Unless you left a backdoor.

Two things identify someone for free, because they identified themselves:
**sending you a message**, and **attacking you**. Neither hands out the odds
bonus — that is only ever earned by playing.

**3. Hack.**  
One attempt. One roll — made by *their* device, not yours, so nobody can modify
their firmware to declare themselves the winner. The result appears on both
displays. They find out the moment your request lands, whether or not you tell
them how it went.

**4. Win** — the node is yours and locked for **12 hours**.

**5. Lose** — locked out of that node for **12 hours**. Move on.

Either way the node closes for 12 hours. When that ends, recon resets too: three
fresh attempts and a clean slate on the sequence bonus — and everything you knew
about them goes dark again, unless you took the backdoor.

Both cooldowns survive a reboot and survive the target walking out of range, so
neither can be reset by power-cycling or waiting for them to drop off your radar.

<img src="docs/img/portal-msgs.png" width="280" align="right" alt="The Msgs tab: a target picker, a 32-character field, the courier bag, and an inbox of five messages, two of them marked as carried via another player">

The Inbox keeps **the last ten messages anyone sent you**, newest first, each
showing the route it took. It survives the sender walking away: the per-node
inbox it replaced held one message per contact and lost all of them a few
minutes after that contact went out of range — which is exactly when you would
want to read them again.

**Talk to them.** 32 characters, straight over the air, no server in between.
Sending someone a message identifies you to them for free — you signed it by
sending it — but it buys them no odds against you. That is the only social
channel in the game, and it is the one people actually use: half of what
happens at a meet-up is negotiated in 32-character bursts.

<br clear="all">

**Hit chance** — one roll, made on the defender's device:
```
base 60%
+ 1.5% per recon sequence step   (max +15% at a perfect 10)
+ 2% per point of Brute Force over their Firewall
+ 1% per point of Stealth       (firewall cannot cancel this)
floor: 25%   ceiling: 90%
```

Brute is contested: it is measured against their Firewall, so it swings hard
both ways and is the stat for cracking hard targets. Stealth is uncontested and
worth half as much per point, but no Firewall can cancel it — the reliable
investment. Recon is the lever you pull per target — and by round 9 it stops
being a bonus and starts being information: their Firewall in hand means the
Radar shows your real odds before you commit instead of "unknown".

No guarantee. Never 100%. RED and GREEN carry their own backfire risks on top,
so their effective win rate is lower than the number shown.

## LoRa protocol

Signal only. No names. No location. Nothing beyond what the game requires.

### Range profiles

**Every device in your game must be flashed with the same profile.** Spreading
factor and frequency are both part of how a LoRa receiver locks onto a signal.
Two devices on different profiles are not weakly connected — they are deaf to
each other and will never appear on each other's radar.

Set it at the top of `cypher32_packets.h`:

```c
#define LORA_PROFILE LORA_PROFILE_LONG
```

| Profile | Radio | Range | Per node | 20 devices |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FAST` | SF7 @ 868.1 MHz, 14 dBm | baseline | 0.30 % | 6 % of channel |
| `LONG` *(default)* | SF9 @ 869.525 MHz, 22 dBm | **~3×** | 0.70 % | 14 % |
| `EPIC` | SF11 @ 869.525 MHz, 22 dBm | **~4.6×** | 1.81 % | 36 % — too crowded |

Two things move range, and this project previously used the short end of both.

**Spreading factor.** SF7 is the *fastest and shortest-range* setting LoRa has.
Every step up is +2.5 dB of receiver sensitivity and double the airtime.

**Sub-band.** ETSI splits 868 MHz into bands with different limits. `g1`
(868.0–868.6) allows 14 dBm and 1 % duty cycle; `g3` (869.4–869.65) allows
27 dBm and **10 %**. The SX1262 caps at 22 dBm, so moving to g3 is +8 dB and
ten times the airtime budget. It is the same band Meshtastic uses for its EU
region, for the same reasons.

Pick `EPIC` only for a handful of people spread across a city. The limit that
bites first is not the law, it is the shared channel: a CAD-gated ALOHA channel
starts losing frames to collisions above roughly a third occupancy, and twenty
devices on `EPIC` would sit at 36 %. Range and capacity are the same budget
spent twice.

Every link-layer timeout is derived from the profile's airtime rather than
hardcoded, so changing the profile re-times the whole stack. `make profiles` in
`test/` builds and runs the suite against all three.

### Range in practice

Firmware is only half of it. Before changing the profile, check:

- **The antenna.** The stock wire antenna is the single biggest variable. It
  must be connected before powering on — transmitting into an open connector
  can damage the radio — and a proper 868 MHz half-wave whip is worth more than
  a spreading factor step.
- **Height and body.** A device in a trouser pocket is being shielded by a bag
  of salt water. Ten metres of elevation beats almost anything you can change
  in software.
- **Line of sight.** The 2–15 km figures are open ground or rooftop to rooftop.
  In a city at street level, expect hundreds of metres at `FAST` and something
  over a kilometre at `LONG`.

All traffic runs at **BW 125 kHz — CR 4/5 — sync 0x12**, with frequency, spreading factor and power set by the profile. Small packets; devices are never quiet for long.

| Packet | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `BEACON` | broadcast | Presence pulse — level and faction only |
| `RECON_REQ` | unicast | Open a scouting link on a target |
| `RECON_REPLY` | unicast | Target returns its full file — level, faction, Brute, Stealth, Firewall |
| `HACK_REQ` | unicast | Attack initiated — carries attacker's Brute |
| `HACK_REPLY` | unicast | Defender returns Firewall and faction |
| `HACK_RESULT` | unicast | Outcome and XP delta sent to defender |
| `MSG` | unicast | Raw text, 32 chars |
| `ACK` | unicast | Link-layer acknowledgement |
| `PING` | unicast | Reliable no-op — round-trip probe |
| `ECHO` | broadcast | A list of the sender's own direct neighbours |
| `MAIL` | unicast | A message being carried on somebody else's behalf |

All of it is defined in `cypher32_packets.h`.

Beacons go out at roughly half the steady interval while you're discovering,
easing off once the neighbourhood is known — 25–35 seconds on `FAST`, longer on
the slower profiles because a beacon at SF11 is thirteen times the airtime of
one at SF7. The interval is jittered: a fixed cadence lets two devices lock into
phase and collide on every single beacon.

Every unicast carries a sequence number and is acknowledged. Unacknowledged
frames are retried up to four times before the portal reports `NO RESPONSE` —
an action never just silently disappears. Duplicates are suppressed, replies are
deferred so they don't collide with the requester re-arming its receiver, and the
radio listens before transmitting.

Every frame also carries a 4-byte HMAC tag keyed on a shared secret.
**Change `LORA_KEY` in `cypher32_packets.h` before you deploy.** It is not real
security — the key is compiled into every device — but it stops someone with a
spare radio injecting packets to award themselves XP.

Airtime is metered against the EU 868 duty cycle limit and diagnostics live at
`192.168.4.1/api/diag`.

### Reaching past your own radio

Two Cyphers that cannot hear each other can still know of each other, and can
still exchange a message — without anything being relayed.

<img src="docs/img/eink-page-census-echo.png" width="300" align="right" alt="The census page with a faction bar chart, and n=3 +3 echo on the title line showing three contacts known only by echo">

**Echoes.** Every couple of minutes each device broadcasts a short list of the
neighbours it can currently hear. You pick that up from someone in range and
learn who *they* can hear: two hops of visibility, and no further, because an
echo is never forwarded. Those contacts appear in their own **ECHOES** section
on the radar, dashed and greyed, showing which of your neighbours bridges to
them.

An echo is a rumour, not a contact. You cannot scout it, cannot hack it, and it
is counted by nothing — not the census, not the leaderboard, not your contacts
total. It has no signal bars either, because the only signal strength anyone
measured belongs to the device that relayed it; printing that would put "VERY
CLOSE" on somebody a kilometre away. It has no codename either, unless you
already own a backdoor on them: recon is still the only way anyone gets a name.

**Courier mail.** You can write to an echo. The message is handed to the
neighbour who can reach them and delivered when those two are next in range —
it travels in somebody's pocket, not over the air. The portal shows what is
waiting and what you are carrying for other people. A message is carried at
most once, so it can never circle; undelivered mail expires after half an hour.

When it arrives it says who brought it. The Inbox marks a carried message
`via <name>`, and the device's message page reads `MAIL BlazeWorm via
VoidShade`. Delivering somebody's post identifies the courier the same way
writing to you does — a codename, nothing more, and no recon bonus with it.

Carrying somebody's mail is worth a line in your log and nothing else. There is
no XP in it, deliberately: the moment relaying pays, the best move is to leave
the device on a windowsill, and this is a game about walking around.

The census page on the device says the same thing in one number: `n=3 +3 echo`
counts the room, then how far past it your knowledge reaches. The echoes are
never added to the census itself — only reported alongside it.

**Why not a full mesh.** Rebroadcasting beacons would cost each device 3.43%
duty cycle in a room of twenty, against a 1% EU legal limit — illegal at six
devices. Echo costs one frame per device per two minutes no matter how many
there are. The full arithmetic is in `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## Device screens

The e-ink screen only refreshes when something happens — a hack result, an incoming message, a level-up, or a mood shift every 10 minutes. No wasted cycles. No flicker mid-play, and nothing at all drawn while the radio is busy.

- **Header** — name, faction initial, level, battery %
- **Character** — idle / focused / victory / defeat
- **Speech bubble** — quips, scan status, hack outcomes
- **Footer** — XP bar, skill bars (B / S / F)

The character notices when you're losing.

**One button, three pages.** A short press on **PRG** side-scrolls the display:
the avatar, then the last message anyone sent you, then the faction census.
Press again and you are back at the avatar. Three markers in the header rule
show where you are. Hold the button instead and nothing happens — the long
hold is still the factory-reset confirm, and it is deliberately unreachable
unless you armed it with a double **RST** tap first.

| Stage | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `lint` | Every ALL-CAPS constant in the sketch resolves to a `#define` |
| `sketch` | **Compiles `cypher32.ino`** against host stubs in `test/stub/` |
| `run` | Link layer (188 checks), a two-node radio simulation over a lossy channel (50), a four-node mesh (69), and the page button (32) |
| `profiles` | The link and mesh suites rebuilt against **all three range profiles** |
| `portal` | The real portal HTML against a DOM shim — render, the mini-game, the alert |
| `layout` | The page in real Chromium at five phone sizes — nothing off-screen, nothing unreachable |
| `flasher` | The browser installer page in real Chromium — the profile picker, the browser gate, a blocked CDN |
| `qr` | The encoder against `python-qrcode`, then the result decoded by OpenCV |

**The firmware is compiled for the real chip in CI.** `.github/workflows/firmware.yml`
builds all three range profiles with PlatformIO on every push, merges each into
a single flashable image, and publishes the installer page. Until that existed,
this firmware had never been built for an ESP32 at all.

Two of the host stages are worth spelling out, because they run where **no
ESP32 toolchain is available** and nothing else covers what they cover:

**`make sketch` builds the firmware against stubs.** `test/render_eink.cpp`
includes `cypher32.ino` and links it against stubs for the display, Wi-Fi, NVS,
the web server and the radio. It will not catch a bad pin mapping or a linker
script problem — that is what the CI build is for — but it catches every typo,
every changed signature and every missing declaration in a second, without
waiting for a toolchain.

**The e-ink screens are rendered, not photographed.** The same program runs the
sketch's own `displayIdle()`, `displayNewNode()` and friends into a 250×122
framebuffer and dumps it. That is where the images in this README come from,
and it is why they cannot drift from the code. It also means the join QR can be
scanned off the panel as the panel would actually draw it — three pixels per
module, beside two lines of text — which `test_qr_panel.py` does on every run.

The portal screenshots come from `test/shoot_portal.js`, which loads the same
HTML blob the device serves into headless Chromium and answers its API calls.
It needs Chromium and Pillow, so it is not part of `make`.

None of this substitutes for the bench test and field protocol in
`ROADMAP.md` — it exercises logic and pixels, not radios.
