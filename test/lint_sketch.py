"""Catch undeclared ALL-CAPS constants in the sketch.

There is no ESP32 toolchain in this repo's test environment, so the .ino is
never compiled here. That let a real bug ship: replacing a block of code by
index also deleted `#define MAX_LEVEL 32`, which sat between two functions, and
nothing noticed until the Arduino IDE refused to build.

This is not a compiler. It only checks that every ALL-CAPS identifier the
sketch uses is defined somewhere in the project or is a known platform symbol —
which is exactly the class of mistake that slipped through.
