//  CYPHER32 LORA — v60
//
//  Roadmap Phases 0-2 and the protocol half of Phase 4.
//
//  What changed from v29, and why:
//
//   D1  no reliability   → seq numbers, ACKs, retry slot     (T1.1 / T1.2)
//   D3  reply race       → replies deferred via TX queue      (T1.3)
//   D4  blocking TX      → startTransmit() state machine      (T1.4)
//   D6  pure ALOHA       → CAD before every TX                (T1.5)
//   D5  no RX watchdog   → 10 s re-arm + 3-strike re-init     (T1.6)
//   D9  no TX diags      → error codes captured, counters     (T0.2)
//   D10 lying API        → loraSendReconStat() deleted        (T4.5)
//   D7  global RSSI      → per-node signal + rolling average   (T2.1)
//   D8  ghost nodes      → TTL, eviction, rollover-safe ages   (T2.2/T2.3)
//   D11 forgeable        → HMAC-signed frames, replay guard    (T4.1/T4.2)
//   D13 hack never sent  → full HACK_REQ/REPLY exchange        (T4.3)
//
//  NOTE ON THE DIO1 HANDLER
//  v29 used setPacketReceivedAction(). That is an RX-only wrapper around
//  setDio1Action(). Now that TX is non-blocking we need one handler serving
//  both TxDone and RxDone, so we use setDio1Action() directly and track which
//  operation is in flight via radioState. The IRQ mask itself is configured by
//  startReceive() / startTransmit(), so a single handler is correct here.

// For the T0.4 bench test, drop the steady pair to 5000 / 5000.
